# asana-exporter
This is meant to help improve the process of generating tasks reports for the SolarWinds project.

## ToDo
- ~~Make export for all registered members in key_manager~~
- ~~Nicer logging of what is happening when asynchronously doing asanaFlow~~
- Implement a temporary or permanent cache for keyFile's password
- Handle what should happen with 'project-less' tasks (mainly private tasks)
- Add the following columns to the exported CSV file:
  - Type of the task
  - ~~Name of person the task is assigned to~~
  - ~~Name of task~~
  - ~~ID of the task~~
- ~~Change ID of project for _Name_ of project in CSV~~
